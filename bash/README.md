# Bash Scripts

##### colors.list:

Included in various other scripts to allow for the use of colors on the command line (will eventually swap this out for tput)

##### youtube-dl-batch.sh

Used for downloading playlists (or individual songs) from youtube to .mp3 files.

TODO

- Have script download list of videos and asyncronously download them all at once
- Include a separate file that has pre-defined playlists

##### pinger

Created for monitoring a slow and intermittent internet connection so that you can audibly hear when the connection goes down (10 pings fail) and when it comes back up afterwards

##### watchLog.sh

Created to monitor the apache logs while working on a school project (watches /var/log/apache2/\*.log and has colors chosen for error.log, access.log, and other_vhosts_access.log)

# Batch Scripts

##### start_spotify.sh

A quick script I threw together because I wanted to use spotify at work, and be able to use the media keys, without installing it.

To use:
1. Copy the spotify installation from your computer to a thumb drive
2. Put this script in the same folder as spotify.exe
3. Use this script instead of spotify.exe.

Spotify will launch and use the files on the USB drive to run. Files will be created in APPDATA to track sessions and such, but this script handles those too. Portableapps.com likes to say no file left behind for portable programs, and I agree.
